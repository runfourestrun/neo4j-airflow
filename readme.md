## Airflow to orchestrate personal Neo4j projects

![](https://github.com/runfourestrun/neo4j-airflow/blob/master/images/img.png)

Graphs to orchestrate:

* Olympics


## Problems:

* Can't disable default Dags
* Also Neo4j Provider/Connector is not being imported. Maybe can get around this not using the Neo4j Operator and hardcoding connections..
